# Pairs of lines: the input (url and host), and the output
# output is the one given by pacrunner_proxy_lookup()
# If this output must be NULL, you will have to write DIRECT.
# For instance:
# http://test.com test.com
# DIRECT

# In case of a PAC file, returning a proxy result it should be:
# http://test.com test.com
# PROXY thetestproxy.com

# If testing malformed url, the output will always be DIRECT
